# Future Directions

        This section outlines potential future enhancements and features for the Syqlorix project.

        -   More specialized element helpers for forms, media etc.
        -   Advanced component system (e.g., with explicit component definition APIs).
        -   Mini dict-based CSS DSL (`syqlorix.css()`) extensions for more complex CSS generation.
        -   More flexible component loading mechanisms.
        -   Direct export to static HTML file (`syqlorix.emit()`).
